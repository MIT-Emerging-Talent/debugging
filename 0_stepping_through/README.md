# Stepping Through

A few small programs that showcase different Python language features. Use these programs to practice:

- Stepping through programs with your debugger
- Finding variables' values in the scope pane
- Understanding a program's _callstack_

To check if you _really_ understand a program, try predictive stepping:

1. Predict which line will execute next and how it will change program state (variables & callstack)
2. Step forward in the program.
3. Check your prediction.
4. Investigate if you were wrong: Is this a bug in the program, or is it something you did not understand?

You can write all the comments you want!
